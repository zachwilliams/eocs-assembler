;; SELF-CONTAINED TESTS
;; This module contains its own tests. The functions:
;;  * attach-to-a
;;  * attach-to-c
;;  * attach-to-label
;;  * attach-instruction-location
;; all have tests associated with them. Implementing
;; the first three makes the implementation of
;; the final function trivial.
;;
;; To run the tests, invoke the function (all-tests)
;; in the interactions pane after running the code.

;; TEST CONTROLS
;; If you want lots of noise (text mode)
(define NOISY false)
;; If you want the GUI for testing.
(define GUI true)

;; CONTRACT
;; attach-to-a :: A number -> A
;; PURPOSE
;; Takes an A instruction and an address, and returns the A
;; instruction with the instruction with the address inserted
;; into the addr field.
(define (attach-to-a instr addr)
  (A addr (A-value instr))
  )

;; CONTRACT
;; attach-to-c :: C number -> C
;; PURPOSE
;; Takes an C instruction and an address, and returns the C
;; instruction with the instruction with the address inserted
;; into the addr field.
(define (attach-to-c instr addr)
  (C addr (C-dest instr) (C-comp instr) (C-jump instr))
  )

;; CONTRACT
;; attach-to-label :: label number -> label
;; PURPOSE
;; Takes an label instruction and an address, and returns the label
;; instruction with the instruction with the address inserted
;; into the addr field.
(define (attach-to-label instr addr)
  (label addr (label-name instr))
  )

;; CONTRACT
;; ail :: (list-of instructions) number -> (list-of instructions)
;; PURPOSE
;; This function actually walks down the list, starting with 
;; address zero, attaching the address (and incrementing appropriately)
;; to each instruction.

    [(empty? loi) '()]

           (ail (rest loi) addr))]

;; CONTRACT
;; attach-instruction-locations :: (list-of instructions) -> l-o-i
;; PURPOSE
;; Consumes a list of instruction structures (A, C, label) and returns
;; the list of instructions rebuilt. As we walk the list, attach an instruction
;; address to each A and C instruction (incrementing the line counter
;; as we proceed). Attach instruction addresses to labels, but do NOT increment
;; the instruction address as you go on---labels will ultimately be removed, and
;; therefore should not count as an instruction address.
