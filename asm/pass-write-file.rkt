;; CONTRACT
;; write-file! :: filename (list-of strings) -> void
;; PURPOSE
;; Takes the original filename and a list of strings
;; representing the machine code for a program, and 
;; writes each string to the file. It does overwrite
;; existing files, but hopefully nothing in the user's directory will
;; have the extention "hack".

                (fprintf op "~a~n" s))
