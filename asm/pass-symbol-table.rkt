;; Originally, the assembler was written in a purely
;; functional style. Truly, this would be better, for

;; represent with a hash table.

;; Loads default symbols into the table.

;; CONTRACT
;; table-add! :: symbol number -> void
;; PURPOSE
;; Adds a new label or memory address to the table.
;; Prevents the addition of the same label or address
;; multiple times.

;; Returns the address associated with the given symbol.

;; PURPOSE
;; Walks through a list of instructions, adding labels to the 
;; lookup table. Increments the address as we go. Remember
;; that a label should not cause the address to go up, as 
;; labels will ultimately be removed. Return the list of instructions
;; as-is.

;; CONTRACT
;; add-memory-addresses-to-table :: (list-of instructions) addr -> (l-o instr)
;; PURPOSE
;; Walks through the table. When we find a symbolic memory reference,
;; (for example, @i), place the variable name into the symbol table, in
;; addition to the address where it is stored. Remember, this will
;; be a function that processes A instructions... but only those A 
;; instructions that have a value field that is symbolic.
;;
;; Rebuild the list of instructions as you go.

;; PURPOSE
;; Takes a list of instructions and rewrites the instruction stream
;; so that no symbolic references remain.
